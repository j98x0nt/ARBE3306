Assessment 3_Briefing Document Building
1 Background
1.1 Assessment 3 - Written Professional Report
1.1.1 The assignment aim is:
(a) To introduce and reinforce the concepts of Fire Safety engineering and compliance through assessment of a performance solution developed using fire safety engineering.
1.1.2 On completion of this assessment the student should be able to:
(a) Apply knowledge of the practical design process adopted by the industry.
(b) Present written and visual concepts and ideas.
1.2 Building
1.2.1 Assessment 3 places you in the role of an employee of a private certifying consultancy firm. In this position you are given a building to work on that is subject to a performance solution as recognised by the Building Code of Australia.
1.2.2 The performance solution will ‘generally’ address the non-compliances with the deemed to satisfy provisions and relevant performance requirements in the Building Code of Australia.
1.2.3 You will be required to review the ‘entire report’ including the ‘performance solutions’ using the principles in the Building Code of Australia and the Australian Fire Engineering Guidelines as a guide in conjunction with the lecture material: provide an executive summary of the solutions and identify any amendments required to the report and solutions to ens代 写ARBE3306 Fire Safety and Compliance Assessment 3C/C++
